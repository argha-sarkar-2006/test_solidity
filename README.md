## 📝 Project Description

**test_solidity** is a **beginner-level Solidity smart contract** built on the **Celo testnet (Celo-Sepolia)**.  
The idea behind test_solidity is to create an **on-chain card matching memory game**, where players can flip and match pairs of cards stored directly on the blockchain.

This project is meant to help newcomers to Solidity understand **smart contract basics**, **events**, and **state management** in a fun and interactive way.

---

## 🎮 What It Does

- Initializes a small deck of cards (e.g., 8 cards → 4 pairs).  
- Players can **start a new game**.  
- They can **select two cards** to see if they match.  
- When a match is found, it’s recorded **on-chain** and the player’s score increases.  
- Once all pairs are matched, the game automatically **ends** and announces the **winner**.

## ✨ Features

✅ Beginner-friendly Solidity structure  
✅ Game logic stored fully on-chain  
✅ Emits events for each important action (`GameStarted`, `CardMatched`, `GameEnded`)  
✅ Simple and easy-to-read code (great for learning)  
✅ Deployed live on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**
